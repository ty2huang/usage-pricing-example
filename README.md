# Sample Dashboard App for Usage Based Pricing

The "squirrels" service (as specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file) can be found in another repo here (see "usage_analytics" folder):
https://github.com/squirrels-analytics/squirrels-examples

Copy the `.env.example` file to both the "usage-pricing-app" and "usage-pricing-backend" folders, renamed as `.env`, and fill in the values.
